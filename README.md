### How to use `$` in feline for images and shell commands:

`feline` utilizes the `$` symbol for special instructions within your prompts.  Here's how to use it:

*   **For Image Processing:**  Use `$[path/to/your/image.jpg]` or `$[path/to/your/image.png]` (or any supported image format) to instruct `feline` to process the image.  Replace `path/to/your/image.jpg` with the actual path to your image file.  For example:
```markdown
feline
> Describe this image: $[/home/user/pictures/my_cat.jpg]
```

*   **For Shell Command Execution:** Use `$()` around your shell command. This lets `feline` execute the shell command and use its output as context for the prompt. For example:
```markdown
feline
> Summarize the output of the 'ls -l' command: $(ls -l)
```

* **Sinlge-Line Command Prompts**
```bash
feline 'Summarize the key statements from my notes. $(cat notes.md)'
```

**Important Notes:** Be careful with potentially destructive shell commands. Ensure you trust the prompt and the commands you are executing.
