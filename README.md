### How to use `$` in feline for images and shell commands:

`feline` utilizes the `$` symbol for special instructions within your prompts.  Here's how to use it:

*   **For Image Processing:**  Use `$[path/to/your/image.jpg]` or `$[path/to/your/image.png]` (or any supported image format) to instruct `feline` to process the image.  Replace `path/to/your/image.jpg` with the actual path to your image file.  For example:
```bash
feline -it
$> [PROMPT] **Press Return 2 times to exit**
$> Describe this image: $[/home/user/pictures/my_cat.jpg]
$>
```

* **Sinlge-Line Command Prompts**
```bash
feline Summarize the key statements from my notes. '$(cat notes.md)'
```

*   **For Shell Command Execution:** Use `$()` around your shell command. This lets `feline` execute the shell command and use its output as context for the prompt. For example:
```bash
feline 'Summarize the output of the ls -l $(ls -l)' -it
$> [FELINE]
The output shows a detailed listing of the user's home directory contents, including: ...

**Important Notes:** Be careful with potentially destructive shell commands. Ensure you trust the prompt and the commands you are executing.
